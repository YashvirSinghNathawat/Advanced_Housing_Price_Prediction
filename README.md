Carried out extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data cleaning, applying PCA to reduce features from 76 to 62
while retaining 97% of the original information, ensuring both data integrity and effective dimensionality reduction.
Utilized nested Grid Search CV to identify and evaluate the optimal model from KNN, Decision Tree, SVR, Random Forest,
Lasso, and Ridge. This approach ensured a thorough assessment of model performance and parameter tuning.
